# IGP: International Graduate Program

Prospective international students interested in joining our lab are strongly encouraged to apply through the IGP program.

We only accept applicants for the IGP(A) or IGP(C) tracks within the Mechanical Engineering Course. Please note that **we do not accept applications for the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Course.**

Additionally, due to the structure of the IGP(A) program and confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, students in IGP(A) may have more restrictions and obligations. If you are considering pursuing a Ph.D., we recommend applying through IGP(C), as it allows for a smoother transition into the doctoral program.

## How to contact with us

If you are interested in joining our lab and studying with us, please contact us through the form linked below.
For security reasons, **we generally do not accept email inquiries**, so please use the form.

Before reaching out, please carefully review the university’s IGP webpage for detailed information.

## Join Our Lab: Innovating Actuators and Industrial Robots
We are looking for students who are passionate about novel actuators and industrial robots, particularly those who can apply AI techniques and computational optimization to create innovative structures and mechanisms. A strong foundation in mechanical and electrical engineering, along with programming skills, is essential.

Please note that we are not currently conducting research on applications of industrial robots. Instead, our focus is on developing actuators and manipulators that will astonish the world.

## Fall 2025 Admission – Early Consultation Recommended
We are now accepting inquiries from prospective students for fall 2025 admission.
Since our lab operates as an industry-funded collaborative research group, the application process involves additional steps compared to regular labs. Early preparation is essential.

## Important Information
Our laboratory is funded by Yaskawa Electric Corporation, and as a result, all research themes are determined through discussions with Yaskawa.
Additionally, while the risk is extremely low, the lab may be discontinued at the end of a fiscal year if Yaskawa decides not to renew its support. The next renewal decision is scheduled for March 2026, and the lab is planned to continue until March 2030.

Even if the lab is discontinued, students will still be able to continue their research under the supervision of another professor, ensuring that your master’s or doctoral research remains unaffected. Only your supervisor and lab affiliation will change.

Due to these unique circumstances, the application process requires more documentation than usual.
Therefore, if you are interested, please notify us as soon as the application details are released.
Additionally, we must complete certain preparations at least two months before the application deadline.

We appreciate your cooperation.
